## Setup

Sometimes you want to keep libraries from polluting system installs or use a different version of libraries than the ones installed on the system. You might also not have permissions to install libraries system-wide. For this purpose, the standard library as of Python 3.3 comes with a concept called “Virtual Environment”s to help maintain these separate versions.

A more in-depth tutorial is found on [Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

However, for the quick and dirty:

Go to your project’s working directory:

```bash
$ cd your-bot-source
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows you activate it with:

```batch
$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Use pip like usual:

```bash
$ pip install -U py-cord
```

Congratulations. You now have a virtual environment all set up.

## Additional info

It can be useful to set up a requirements.txt, so you can just put all of your dependencies in there and have pip install it.
For instance, if you wanted to have the latest 2.0 version of pycord and [pytz](https://github.com/stub42/pytz/blob/master/src/README.rst), just create a file named requirements.txt with the following contents:

```
py-cord>=2.0.0
pytz
```

And then (in your virtual environment) you can just execute

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To keep from committing your virtual environment to git, you can set up a .gitignore file with the following line
(assuming you named your virtual environment venv like the above example):

```
venv/
```
