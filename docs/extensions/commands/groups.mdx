title: Command Groups

Command groups are a way to create subcommands for your commands. For example, `!afk set` or `!afk
remove`.

## Syntax

Creating a command group is very simple.

```python title="Command Groups Example"
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.group()
async def afk():
    pass

@afk.command()
async def set():
    ...

@afk.command()
async def remove():
    ...

# Another command group

@bot.group(invoke_without_command=True) # Indicates if the group callback should begin parsing and invocation only if no subcommand was found.
async def math(ctx):
    await ctx.send('Subcommand not found')

@math.command()
async def add(ctx, a: int, b: int):
    ...

@math.command()
async def subtract(ctx, a: int, b: int):
    ...
```

To create a command group, the command's decorator must be `@bot.group`. Once you have a command with
that decorator, you can use `@function.command()`, such as `@math.command()`. Now, you have subcommand
groups!
