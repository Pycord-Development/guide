Before you can start using Pycord, you need to install the library.

:::note
Python **3.8 or above** is required to use Pycord.
:::

:::tip
Before you start installing python packages globally, it's recommended you set up a virtual environment.
You can find instructions for that [here](More/virtual-environments).
:::

## Fresh Installation

To install Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    pip install py-cord

:::tip
Remember that you need to install `py-cord`, not `pycord`.
Also, the `pip` command varies depending on your installation. For example, it might be `python3 -m pip` on macOS/Linux or `py3 -m pip` on some versions of Windows.
:::

If you need voice support for your bot, you should run:

    pip install "py-cord[voice]"

## Migration

### Updating Pycord

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal to upgrade to the latest version:

    pip install -U py-cord

### Migrating from other libraries

If you are migrating from another library, say, `discord.py`, first of all, you need to uninstall it.

    pip uninstall discord.py

Then, you can install Pycord, it's as simple as that!:

    pip install py-cord

:::caution
Uninstalling `discord.py` *after* installing `py-cord` can cause issues. Make sure to uninstall it first!
:::

## Installing Other Builds

### Development Build

:::caution
The development build comes with cutting edge features and new functionality, but as it isn't a stable build you may encounter bugs.
:::

To install the development build, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

:::important
Git is required to install this build. [Learn how you can install Git](./more/git).
