title: Installation
---

Before you can start using Pycord, you need to install the library.

:::note
Python **3.8 or above** is required to use Pycord.
:::

## Fresh Installation

To install Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    python3 -m pip install py-cord

:::tip
Remember that you need to install `py-cord`, not `pycord`.
Also, the `python3` command varies depending on your installation. It might be `python` or `python3.8` as an example.
:::

If you need voice support for your bot, you should run:

    python3 -m pip install "py-cord[voice]"

## Migration

### Updating Pycord

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal to upgrade to the latest version:

    python3 -m pip install -U py-cord

### Migrating from other libraries

If you are migrating from another library, say, `discord.py`, first of all, you need to uninstall it.

    python3 -m pip uninstall discord.py

Then, you can install Pycord, it's as simple as that!:

    python3 -m pip install py-cord

:::caution
Uninstalling `discord.py` *after* installing `py-cord` can cause issues. Make sure to uninstall it first!
:::

## Installing Other Builds

### Development Build

:::caution
The development build comes with cutting edge features and new functionality, but as it isn't a stable build you may encounter bugs.
:::

To install the development build, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

:::important
