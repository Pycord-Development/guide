title: Installation
---

Before you can start using Pycord, you need to install the library.

:::note
Python **3.8 or above** is required to use Pycord.
:::

## Fresh Installation

To install Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    python3 -m pip install py-cord

:::tip
Remember that you need to install `py-cord`, not `pycord`.
Also, the `python3` command varies depending on your install. It might be `python` or `python3.8` for example.
:::

If you need voice support for your bot, you should run:

    python3 -m pip install "py-cord[voice]"

## Migration

### Updating Pycord

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Pycord, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    python3 -m pip install -U py-cord

### Migrating from other libraries

If you are migrating from another library, say, `discord.py`, first of all, you need to uninstall it.

    python3 -m pip uninstall discord.py

Then, you can install Pycord:

    python3 -m pip install py-cord

:::caution
Uninstalling `discord.py` *after* installing `py-cord` can cause issues.
:::

## Installing Other Builds

### Development Build

:::caution
The development build may not be stable and cause bugs.
:::

To install the development build, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

:::important
Git is required to install this build. [Learn how you can install Git](/guide/Topics/git).

## FAQ

### Why is it that the library called Pycord but the package is called py-cord?

Pycord was a name taken from an FFmpeg wrapper for python,
which is no longer maintained, henceforth we had to make the pypi name `py-cord`.
we have tried several times to get the pypi name but have been unsuccessful.
