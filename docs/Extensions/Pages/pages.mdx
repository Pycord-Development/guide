## Paginator Components

### [Page](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/ext/pages/index.html#page)
This class contains two attributes: `content` and `embeds`, which correspond to the attributes of the same name on the `discord.Message` class.
To create a new Page, use the following syntax:
```py
import discord
page = Page(content="My Page Content", embeds=[discord.Embed(title="My First Embed Title")])
```

### [PageGroup](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/ext/pages/index.html#pagegroup)
This class represents a group of pages. It uses most of the same parameters as `Paginator`, which allows each `PageGroup` to effectively have its own settings and behaviours.

### [Paginator](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/ext/pages/index.html#paginator)
This is the main class for `ext.pages`, and is used to control most of the functionality of the extension.

In its most basic form, with no arguments provided (default values listed below), a paginator can be created like so:

```py title="Paginator Example"
import discord
from discord.ext.pages import Paginator, Page

my_pages = [
    Page(
        content="This is my first page. It has a list of embeds and message content.",
        embeds=[
            discord.Embed(title="My First Embed Title"),
            discord.Embed(title="My Second Embed Title"),
        ],
    ),
    Page(
        content="This is my second page. It only has message content.",
    ),
    Page(
        embeds=[
            discord.Embed(
                title="This is my third page.",
                description="It has no message content, and one embed.",
            )
        ],
    ),
]
paginator = Paginator(pages=my_pages)
```

The only required parameter for `Paginator` is the `pages` parameter, which is usually a list of `Page` objects.

However, you can also pass in a list of `PageGroup` objects, a list of strings, a list of embeds, or a list of embeds.

#### Depending on what's being passed to the `pages` parameter, the behaviour of the paginator may differ:

- Passing a list of `PageGroup` objects will essentially treat each `PageGroup` as its own Paginator, with most `Paginator` attributes able to be set independently for each `PageGroup`.
  - Each `PageGroup` accepts its own `pages` parameter, which inherits the same behaviour as the `pages` parameter of `Paginator`, except it cannot contain other `PageGroup` objects.
- If a page is a `Page` object, this will allow you to specify both the `discord.Message.content` and `discord.Message.embeds` attributes for a page.
  - **This is the preferred method of defining a page.**
- If a page is a string, this will be used for the `discord.Message.content` attribute. This type of page cannot have any embeds.
- If a page is a list of embeds, this will be used for the `discord.Message.embeds` attribute. This type of page cannot have any message content.
- If a page is a list of lists of embeds, each parent list item will create a page containing all embeds from its child list. This type of page cannot have any message content.

#### Parameters for the `Paginator` class which have default values:
- `show_disabled` **:** `True`
  - Show buttons that are disabled (i.e. can't be clicked)
- `author_check` **:** `True`
  - Only the author can interact with the paginator.
- `timeout` **:** `180` *(seconds)*
  - The paginator will time out and become inactive after this many seconds.
- `disable_on_timeout` **:** `True`
  - If the paginator times out, it will be automatically disabled and all buttons will be unusable.
- `use_default_buttons` **:** `True`
  - Use the default set of 4 buttons and a page indicator.
- `show_indicator` **:** `True`
  - When using the default buttons, shows a middle 5th button with the current/total page numbers.

#### Other parameters that can be set on initialization:
- `show_menu`
  - Whether to show a select menu that allows the user to switch between groups of pages.
  - Has no effect if PageGroups are not provided for the paginator.
- `default_button_row`
  - Which row should the default buttons be displayed in? 
  - Defaults to 0 and has no effect if `use_default_buttons` is not `True`
- `loop_pages`
  - Whether to loop the pages when clicking prev/next while at the first/last page in the list.
  - If this is `True`, you can also define a `loop_label` for any custom `PaginatorButton` objects you create. 
- `custom_buttons`
  - A list of PaginatorButtons to initialize the Paginator with.
  - If `use_default_buttons` is `True`, this parameter is ignored.
- `custom_view`
  - A custom view whose items are added to the pagination components.

#### Attributes that can be set or accessed after the paginator is created:
- `pages`
  - The only required parameter when creating a paginator instance.
- `page_groups`
  - List of `PageGroup` objects the user can switch between.
- `menu`
  - The page group select menu associated with this paginator.
- `current_page`
  - A zero-indexed value shows the current page number.
- `page_count`
  - A zero-indexed value shows the total number of pages.
- `buttons`
  - A dictionary containing the `PaginatorButton` objects is included in this paginator.
- `user`
  - The user or member that invoked the paginator.
- `message`
  - The message the paginator is attached to.


### PaginatorButton
This class represents a button used to navigate between the pages of a paginator. It's also used to create the page indicator.

When creating your own custom buttons, you can either use this class directly or subclass it to add any additional functionality you may need.

### PaginatorMenu
This class represents the `discord.Select` menu used to navigate between `PageGroup` instances. If it's subclassed, you'll most likely want to call `super()` in your `__init__` method.
