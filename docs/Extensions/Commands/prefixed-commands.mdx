Before Discord added slash commands, all bots had prefixed commands. A user would type the bot's prefix
followed by a word or phrase to invoke a command, such as `?help` or `!help`.
However, this prefixed commands system isn't native to Discord! Developers made use of an `on_message`
event to check if the message began with a certain character, then invoke the command. Every time a
message was sent, the bot would see the message and check for its "prefix"

The syntax becomes a little more complicated when you want to have multiple commands. There are several
disadvantages to this system. This is where the commands extension comes in. `ext.commands` has
various advantages, such as:

- Simpler syntax
- Easier to use
- Easier to parse user input
- Comes with built-in help commands
- Comes with a built-in system for categorizing commands

:::tip

The commands extension has many more uses. This example only showcases the basic features mentioned
in the previous example. Other things you can do with the commands extension include using a different
built-in help command and creating your own. The following tutorials showcase these.

## Syntax

Before we check out the syntax, let's take a look at the bot classes.

> `discord.Client` - Contains only events.
>
> `discord.Bot` - Subclasses `discord.Client`, adds commands.
>
> `discord.ext.commands.Bot` - Subclasses `discord.Bot`, adds prefixed commands, cogs, and more.

This means that `discord.ext.commands.Bot` has both slash commands and prefixed commands, as well as
events, cogs and more.

Now let's look at the syntax.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands # Import the commands extension
# discord.ext.commands is not the same as discord.commands!

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!") # You can change the command prefix to whatever you want.

@bot.command() # This is the decorator we use to create a prefixed command.
async def ping(ctx): # This is the function we will use to create the command.
    await ctx.send("Pong!") # This is the response the bot will send.


bot.run("token") # Run the bot with your token.
```

      <br />
      Type !help command for more info on a command.
      <br />
      You can also type !help category for more info on a category.

The help command is a built-in command and is enabled by default. You will learn more about it in the
following guides.

## Parameters

Prefixed commands can take parameters, just like slash commands. You can specify the parameters in
the function itself.

```python {2}
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, *, message):
    await ctx.send(message)
```

`ctx` is the context of the message. `*` means that the parameter can be any number of words. `message`
is the parameter. If you had not passed `*`, `message` would only have been one word.

For example, if a user had used `!echo hello world`, `message` would have been `hello`. Since we 
passed `*`, `message` is `hello world`, or the rest of the message.

We can pass multiple parameters too!

```python
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, channel:discord.TextChannel, title, *, message):
    await channel.send("**{}**\n{}".format(title, message))
```

In the example above, `channel` is a parameter that is of type `discord.TextChannel`. When you
specify the type of the parameter, Pycord will automatically try to convert the parameter to that type.
That is why you are able to use `channel.send` directly without needing to convert it first.

We also have a new parameter, `title`. This does not have a type, so it will be a string. `*` means
that the rest of the message belongs to the next parameter, in this case, `message`.

When a user types `!echo #general Greetings! Hello World!`, `channel` will be the text channel
`#general`, `title` will be `Greetings!` and `message` will be `Hello World!`.

Let's take an example where the user passes `!echo #general Holiday Greetings! Greetings to you all!`.
Here, the user wants the title to be "Holiday Greetings!" and the message to be "Greetings to you all!".
However, since Pycord parses the message at whitespaces, the title will end up being "Holiday" and the
message "Greetings! Greetings to you all!". The user can prevent this by typing `!echo "Holiday
Greetings!" Greetings to you all!`.

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Santa Claus" avatar="blue">
    !echo #general Holiday Greetings! Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="Elf" avatar="red" bot>
    <strong>Holiday</strong>
    <br />
    Greetings! Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="Mrs. Claus" avatar="green">
    !echo #general "Holiday Greetings!" Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="Elf" avatar="red" bot>
    <strong>Holiday Greetings!</strong>
    <br />
    Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Let's check out another example for parameters and parameter types.

```python
import random

@bot.command()
async def gtn(ctx, guess:int):
    number = random.randint(1, 10)
    if guess == number:
        await ctx.send("You guessed it!)
    else:
        await ctx.send("Nope! Better luck next time :)")
```

If you had not specified the type of the parameter, it would have been a string. And since `"5"` is not
the same as `5` in python, the bot would have responded with "Nope! Better luck next time :)".
Even if you do not specify the type of the parameter, you can still convert it later on, in this case,
with `int(guess)`.
