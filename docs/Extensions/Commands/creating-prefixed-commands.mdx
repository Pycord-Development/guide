Before Discord added slash commands, all bots had prefixed commands. A user would type `!ping` or `?ping` or whatever the bot's prefix was to get a response.
However, this prefixed commands system isn't native to Discord! Developers made use of the `on_message` event to check if the message began with a `!ping`. So every time a message was sent, the bot would check if it began with the prefix, or with the command name.

The syntax becomes a little more complicated when you want to have multiple commands. There are several more disadvances to this system. This is where the commands extention comes in.
`ext.commands` has various advantages, such as:

- Simpler syntax
- Easier to use
- Easier to parse user input
- Comes with build-in help commands
- Comes with a built-in system for categorizing commands

```python
import discord

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.content.startswith("!ping"):
        await message.channel.send("Pong!")

    elif message.content.startswith("!announce"):
        if len(message.content.split(" ")) < 3:
            await message.channel.send("You need to specify a title and a message. Correct usage: `!announce Hello Hello everyone!`")
            return

        msg = message.content.split(" ", 2)
        title = msg[1]
        content = msg[2]

        await message.channel.send("**{}**\n{}".format(title, content))

    elif message.content.startswith("!"):
        await message.channel.send("Unknown command.")
```

You can do much more with the commands extention! This example only showcases the same features as the previous example. You can use a different built-in help command, or even create your own! You will learn about creating Help Commands and Categories in the next tutorials.
