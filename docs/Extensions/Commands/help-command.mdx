Pycord's `commands` extension comes with a built-in help command. In this guide, we will take a look at them as well as learn how to create your own. Let's dive in!

:::note

This guide demonstrates using object-oriented programming and subclassing to make a help command for your
Pycord bot. It is important to understand these two concepts before continuing.

**Learning Resources**:

- [W3Schools - Python Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp)

## The Wrong Way

A popular way to create a help command is to disable the built-in help command and create your own. This is not recommended as it will lead to a lot of confusion.

```python title="The Wrong Way"
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', help_command=None)
# OR
bot.help_command = None
# OR
bot.remove_command("help")

@bot.command()
async def help(ctx, *, argument=None):
  ...
```

While it's possible to create a help command this way, doing so does not utilize the full capabilities
of making one with Pycord. Making a help command with subclassing and OOP will save time and effort.

## Types of Help Commands

There are two types of built-in help commands:

- [`DefaultHelpCommand`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ext.commands.DefaultHelpCommand)
- [`MinimalHelpCommand`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ext.commands.MinimalHelpCommand)

`DefaultHelpCommand` is the command enabled by default. It isn't the best looking, but `MinimalHelpCommand` can help make it look a bit better.

<TabItem label="Default Help Command" value="default">

```python title="Default Help Command"
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', help_command=commands.DefaultHelpCommand()) # help_command is DefaultHelpCommand by default so it isn't nessesary to enable it like this
# We enable it here for the sake of understanding

...

bot.run("token")
```

      <br />

      <br />
      You can also type !help category for more info on a category.

```

## Updating Build-in Help Commands

Let's try to make the `MinimalHelpCommand` look better. We can do this by putting its content in an
embed.

```python title="Minimal Help Command Example"
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')


class MyNewHelp(commands.MinimalHelpCommand):
    async def send_pages(self):
        destination = self.get_destination()
        for page in self.paginator.pages:
            emby = discord.Embed(description=page)
            await destination.send(embed=emby)

bot.help_command = MyNewHelp()
```

Let's go through the code.

First, we create a new class called `MyNewHelp`. This class is a subclass of `MinimalHelpCommand`.

Next, we override the `send_pages` method. This method is responsible for sending the help command to
the user. We override this method because we don't want to change the content of the pages, just how
they are sent.

We use the `get_destination` method to get the destination of the message. This is the channel or use
 that the help command is to be sent to.

We use the `paginator.pages` property to get the different pages of the help command. We put the page
in an embed, and then send the embed to the destination channel.

Finally, we set this as our new help command using `bot.help_command = MyNewHelp()`.

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <DiscordEmbed>
      Use <code>!help [command]</code> for more info on a command.
      <br />
      You can also use <code>!help [category]</code> for more info on a
      category.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>
        {" "}
        <u>No Category</u>{" "}
      </strong>
      <br />
      help ping
    </DiscordEmbed>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

## Creating Your Help Command

Not satisfied with the built-in help commands? You can create your own!

For this, we will subclass the `HelpCommand` class.

There are 4 methods that we need to override:

- `HelpCommand.send_bot_help(mapping)` that gets called with `<prefix>help`
- `HelpCommand.send_command_help(command)` that gets called with `<prefix>help <command>`
- `HelpCommand.send_group_help(group)` that gets called with `<prefix>help <group>`
- `HelpCommand.send_cog_help(cog)` that gets called with `<prefix>help <cog>`

### Bot Help

```python title="Bot Help Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    async def send_bot_help(self, mapping):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Help")
        for cog, commands in mapping.items():
           command_signatures = [self.get_command_signature(c) for c in commands]
           if command_signatures:
                cog_name = getattr(cog, "qualified_name", "No Category")
                embed.add_field(name=cog_name, value="\n".join(command_signatures), inline=False)

        channel = self.get_destination()
        await channel.send(embed=embed)

bot.help_command = MyHelp()
```

Let's go through the code.

- First, we create a new class called `MyHelp`. This class is a subclass of `HelpCommand`.

- Next, we override the `send_bot_help` method. This method is responsible for sending the main help
command to the user.

- We create an embed with the title "Help".

- We iterate through `mapping.items()`, which returns a list of tuples, the first element being the
cog and the second element being a list of commands.

- By using `self.get_command_signature(c)` we get the signature of the command, also known as the
`parameters` or `arguments`.

- There is a chance that the cog is empty, so we use `if command_signatures:`.

- We get the name of the cog using `getattr(cog, "qualified_name", "No Category")`. This calls the
cog's attribute `qualified_name` which returns "No Category" if the cog has no name.

- We add a field to the embed with the name of the cog and the value of the command signatures.

- Finally, we send the embed to the channel.

Let's improve the code a little.

```python title="Improved Bot Help Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '%s%s %s' % (self.context.clean_prefix, command.qualified_name, command.signature)

    async def send_bot_help(self, mapping):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Help", color=discord.Color.blurple())

        for cog, commands in mapping.items():
           filtered = await self.filter_commands(commands, sort=True)
           command_signatures = [self.get_command_signature(c) for c in filtered]

           if command_signatures:
                cog_name = getattr(cog, "qualified_name", "No Category")
                embed.add_field(name=cog_name, value="\n".join(command_signatures), inline=False)

        channel = self.get_destination()
        await channel.send(embed=embed)

bot.help_command = MyHelp()
```

Now the help command won't show commands that the user can't use, as well as aliases for commands.
Let's get the help command to show command aliases.

### Command Help

This function is called when the user uses `<prefix>help <command>`.

```python title="Command Help Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    async def send_command_help(self, command):
        embed = discord.Embed(title=self.get_command_signature(command), color=discord.Color.random())
        if command.help:
            embed.description = command.help
        if alias := command.aliases:
            embed.add_field(name="Aliases", value=", ".join(alias), inline=False)

        channel = self.get_destination()
        await channel.send(embed=embed)

bot.help_command = MyHelp()
```

Let's quickly go through the code we haven't discussed yet.

- In line 3, we create an embed with a title the signature of the command (so that the title of the
embed looks like `<command> <parameter> [parameter]`), and a random color.

- In lines 4 and 5, we get the command's `help` description and add it to the embed. The help description
of a command can be specified in the docstrings of a command function. For example:

  ```python
  @bot.command()
  async def ping(ctx):
      """Returns the latency of the bot."""
      await ctx.send(f"Pong! {round(bot.latency * 1000)}ms")
  ```
- Line 6 is shorthand for

  ```python
  alias = command.aliases
  if alias:
    ...

  # is the same as

  if alias := command.aliases:
    ...
  ```

  A very helpful (but not well-known) Python shorthand!

- In line 7, we get the aliases of the command and add them to the embed.

### Cog Help

This is pretty easy!

```python title="Custom Cog Help Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '%s%s %s' % (self.context.clean_prefix, command.qualified_name, command.signature)

    async def send_cog_help(self, cog):
        embed = discord.Embed(title=cog.qualified_name or "No Category", description=cog.description, color=discord.Color.blurple())

        if filtered_commands := await self.filter_commands(cog.get_commands()):
            for command in filtered_commands:
                embed.add_field(name=self.get_command_signature(command), value=command.help or "No Help Message Found... ")

        await self.get_destination().send(embed=embed)
```

Once again, we create an embed, get the commands that the user can use, and add them to the embed.

### Group Help

Similar to the cog help, this is pretty easy!

```python title = "Custom Group Help Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '%s%s %s' % (self.context.clean_prefix, command.qualified_name, command.signature)

    async def send_group_help(self, group):
        embed = discord.Embed(title=self.get_command_signature(group), description=group.help, color=discord.Color.blurple())

        if filtered_commands := await self.filter_commands(group.commands):
            for command in filtered_commands:
                embed.add_field(name=self.get_command_signature(command), value=command.help or "No Help Message Found... ")

        await self.get_destination().send(embed=embed)
```

Add all of these methods together and you have a fully functioning help command!

```python title="Custom Help Command Example"
class SupremeHelpCommand(commands.HelpCommand):
    def get_command_signature(self, command):
        return '%s%s %s' % (self.context.clean_prefix, command.qualified_name, command.signature)

    async def send_bot_help(self, mapping):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Help", color=discord.Color.blurple())
        for cog, commands in mapping.items():
            filtered = await self.filter_commands(commands, sort=True)
            if command_signatures := [
                self.get_command_signature(c) for c in filtered
            ]:
                cog_name = getattr(cog, "qualified_name", "No Category")
                embed.add_field(name=cog_name, value="\n".join(command_signatures), inline=False)

        channel = self.get_destination()
        await channel.send(embed=embed)

    async def send_command_help(self, command):
        embed = discord.Embed(title=self.get_command_signature(command) , color=discord.Color.blurple())
        if command.help:
            embed.description = command.help
        if alias := command.aliases:
            embed.add_field(name="Aliases", value=", ".join(alias), inline=False)

        channel = self.get_destination()
        await channel.send(embed=embed)

    async def send_help_embed(self, title, description, commands): # a helper function to add commands to an embed
        embed = discord.Embed(title=title, description=description or "No help found...")

        if filtered_commands := await self.filter_commands(commands):
            for command in filtered_commands:
                embed.add_field(name=self.get_command_signature(command), value=command.help or "No help found...")

        await self.get_destination().send(embed=embed)

    async def send_group_help(self, group):
        title = self.get_command_signature(group)
        await self.send_help_embed(title, group.help, group.commands)

    async def send_cog_help(self, cog):
        title = cog.qualified_name or "No"
        await self.send_help_embed(f'{title} Category', cog.description, cog.get_commands())

bot.help_command = SupremeHelpCommand()
```

</div>
</details>

## Command Attributes

How can you add cooldowns, set aliases, and change the name of help commands? Command attributes can
help you do all of that, and more!

```python title="Help Command Attributes"
attributes = {
   'name': "help",
   'aliases': ["helpme"],
   'cooldown': commands.CooldownMapping.from_cooldown(3, 5, commands.BucketType.user),
}

# You need to use CooldownMapping.from_cooldown(rate, per, type)

bot.help_command = MyHelp(command_attrs=attributes)
```

## Error Handling

When a user attempts to use a command that does not exist, we need to inform the user.
We can do this by overriding the `send_error_message` function.

```python title="Custom Help Error Example"
class MyHelp(commands.HelpCommand):
    async def send_error_message(self, error):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Error", description=error, color=discord.Color.red())
        channel = self.get_destination()

        await channel.send(embed=embed)
```
