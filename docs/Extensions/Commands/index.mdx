Before Discord added slash commands, all bots had prefixed commands. A user would type `!ping` or `?ping` or whatever the bot's prefix was to get a response.
However, this prefixed commands system isn't native to Discord! Developers made use of the `on_message` event to check if the message began with a `!ping`. So every time a message was sent, the bot would check if it began with the prefix, or with the command name.

The syntax becomes a little more complicated when you want to have multiple commands. There are several more disadvances to this system. This is where the commands extention comes in.
`ext.commands` has various advantages, such as:

  - Simpler syntax
  - Easier to use
  - Easier to parse user input
  - Comes with build-in help commands
  - Comes with a built-in system for categorizing commands

@client.event
async def on_message(message):

    await message.channel.send("Pong!")
```

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!") # You can change the prefix to whatever you want

@bot.command()
async def ping(ctx):
  await ctx.send("Pong!")
```
