Opus is also a required library, but this comes with Pycord.
Some hosts may not come with it, though, so remember to always check if required dependencies are installed.

* [`Pycord.Wavelink`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/Pycord.Wavelink),
  [`Lavalink.py`](https://github.com/Devoxin/Lavalink.py),
