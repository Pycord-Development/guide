# Pycord Guide

Imagine a place, a place where you can learn how to make a Discord bot, how Pycord works and the techniques it uses to make your bot fast and reliable, how to add more advanced features to your Pycord bot without feeling so advanced, and a whole lot more.

## What is Pycord?

Pycord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. Pycord is a maintained fork of [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that helps you create Discord bots with Python.
