Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files (also known as a "version control" software), usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Let's see how to install Git on different platforms.

## Windows

On windows, Git can be installed via:

- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
