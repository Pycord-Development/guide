title: Installing Git
---

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Let's see how we can install Git on different platforms.

## Windows

On windows, Git can be installed via:

 - [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
 - [Git Scm](https://git-scm.com/download/windows)

## Linux

On Linux, Git is probably already installed in your distros repository. If not, you can install it via [Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

## Mac

You may have to install it via [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

## Using Package Managers

You can install Git using package managers.

### Choco

If you use the Choco package manager, you can install Git using:

    choco install git
