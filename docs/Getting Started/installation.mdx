### Migrating from other libraries

Then, you can install Pycord:

    python3 -m pip install py-cord

:::caution

## FAQ

### Why is it that the library called Pycord but the package is called py-cord?

Pycord is also the name of another API Wrapper. However, that wrapper is not maintained any longer. PyPi does not allow you to install a package with the same name as another package. Therefore, this new library had to be called `py-cord`. However, since it's harder to keep calling it Py-cord, we decided to call it Pycord.
