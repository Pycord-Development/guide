## Project Ideas

### 1. Guide Remake

**Size:** Small (90 hours) or Medium (175 hours)

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Category:** Infrastructure

**Mentor:** [Paillat](https://github.com/Paillat-dev)

#### Description

The current Pycord guide at [guide.pycord.dev](https://guide.pycord.dev) has accumulated technical debt and contains outdated content. We need a complete remake using modern web technologies to provide a good learning experience for new Pycord developers.

This project involves both documentation and web development work. You'll be rebuilding the guide from the ground up with a modern tech stack while updating all tutorials and examples to reflect current Discord API features and Pycord best practices.

The new guide should serve as the primary learning resource for developers new to Pycord, covering everything from basic bot setup to advanced features.

#### Expected Outcomes

- New guide website built with Astro framework and Tailwind CSS v4
- Updated tutorials covering the latest Discord features and Pycord capabilities
- Modern, responsive design that works seamlessly across devices
- Beginner-friendly documentation

#### Stretch Goals (Medium / 175h scope)

- Full working code examples integrated and continuously synchronized from the core GitHub repository
- Video tutorials or animated examples for complex concepts
- Multi-language support or internationalization framework using Crowdin
- Advanced topics section covering best practices and optimization

#### Skills Required/Preferred

Non-negotiable:

- Python (intermediate level)
- Technical writing and documentation skills
- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Basic understanding of Discord bots and the Discord API

Preferred:

- Experience with Astro framework
- Strong knowledge of Tailwind CSS
- Prior experience writing developer documentation
- Familiarity with Pycord or discord.py

#### Resources

- Current Guide: [guide.pycord.dev](https://guide.pycord.dev)

### 2. Pycord-next: The Future of Pycord

**Size:** Medium (175 hours) or Large (350 hours)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Category:** Core Development

**Mentor:** [Paillat](https://github.com/Paillat-dev)

#### Description

Pycord-next is an ambitious ongoing refactor that aims to modernize and improve the core architecture of Pycord. This project is not about completing the entire refactor, but rather making meaningful, substantial contributions that push the project forward.

As a contributor, you'll work closely with mentors and the core team to understand Pycord's internals, make architectural decisions, and implement changes that will shape the future of the library. This is a unique opportunity to have a lasting impact on a library used by thousands of Discord bot developers.

Success in this project means demonstrating the ability to understand complex async Python codebases, make well-reasoned design decisions, and implement clean, well-typed, well-documented code.

#### Expected Outcomes

- Meaningful contributions to the pycord-next refactor following the project roadmap
- Well-documented code changes with comprehensive type annotations
- Participation in architectural discussions and decision-making
- Pull requests that advance specific areas of the refactor (models, gateway, HTTP client, etc.)
- Understanding and documentation of design decisions for future contributors

Potential focus areas:

- Model system refactoring
- Gateway connection handling improvements
- HTTP client modernization
- Type system improvements and full typing coverage

#### Skills Required/Preferred

Non-negotiable:

- Advanced Python knowledge
- Strong understanding of async/await and asyncio
- Solid grasp of Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Experience with Python type hints and static typing
- Ability to read and understand large codebases

Preferred:

- Prior experience with Pycord or discord.py
- Understanding of the Discord API and WebSocket protocols
- Experience with API wrapper design patterns
- Familiarity with modern Python tooling (mypy, ruff, etc.)

#### Important Note

Applicants interested in this project should spend significant time exploring the Pycord codebase before applying. We expect candidates to demonstrate familiarity with the library's architecture in their proposals.

#### Resources

- Pycord-next Repository: [github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord-next](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord-next)
- Main Pycord Repository: [github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord)
- Discord API Documentation: [discord.com/developers/docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs)

### 3. Discord Bot Testing Framework

**Size:** Medium (175 hours) or Large (350 hours)

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Category:** Infrastructure/Automation

**Mentor:** [Paillat](https://github.com/Paillat-dev)

#### Description

Testing Discord bots is notoriously difficult because they rely on external services and real-time events. This project aims to create a comprehensive testing framework that allows developers to write reliable, reproducible tests for their Pycord bots.

The framework should allow users to simulate Discord events, mock API responses, and verify bot behavior without needing a real Discord connection. This involves creating a new repository with the testing tools as well as potential contributions to Pycord core to ensure compatibility and testability.

#### Expected Outcomes

- A standalone testing library for Pycord bots (new repository)
- Event simulation system allowing developers to trigger customizable mock events
- Response verification tools to check bot outputs and API calls
- Mock Discord API client for offline testing
- Integration with popular Python testing frameworks (pytest)
- Comprehensive documentation and example test suites

#### Stretch Goals (Large / 350h scope)

- Integration testing tools for multi-bot scenarios
- Performance testing utilities
- CI/CD integration examples and GitHub Actions templates
- Contributions to Pycord core for improved testability

#### Skills Required/Preferred

Non-negotiable:

- Advanced Python knowledge
- Experience with testing frameworks (pytest preferred)
- Understanding of mocking and test doubles
- Familiarity with async Python testing patterns

Preferred:

- Experience with Pycord or discord.py
- Knowledge of the Discord API structure
- Prior experience building testing tools or frameworks
- Understanding of CI/CD pipelines

#### Resources

- Pycord Repository: [github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord)
- pytest Documentation: [docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org)
- Discord API Documentation: [discord.com/developers/docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs)
