description: Threads with Pycord
---

In programming, threads are a way to run multiple processes at the same time. In Discord, threads are a way to keep multiple conversations going at the same time. Let's take a brief look at how to use threads in Pycord.

:::tip

Not all the methods and attributes will be covered in this guide, but you can find them in the documentation! [Check it out!](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Thread)

## Creating a thread

With a few lines of code, we can create threads in Pycord. 

:::important

All public threads need a starting message. This message will start the thread. However, private threads (which can be unlocked with server boosting level 2) do not require a starting message.

:::

### Creating thread from a message

```python
message = await something.send("My Starting Message")
await message.create_thread(name="thread name", auto_archive_duration=60)
```

You may also use other ways to create the thread, for example, by using `on_message` events or by commands.

### Creating thread in a channel

```python
channel = bot.get_channel(...) # define this!
await channel.create_thread(name="Thread Name", message=None, auto_archive_duration=60, type=None, reason=None)
```

A thread type could be `news_thread`, `public_thread`, `private_thread`. You may use it by passing `type=discord.ChannelType.news_thread`.

## Deleting Threads

Deleting Threads is simple. You just need to get a thread, and then use the `delete` method.

```python
thread = bot.get_channel(thread_id) # you could use other ways to get a thread
await thread.delete()
```

## Editing Threads

__**Parameters**__

  - `name` (str) – The new name of the thread

  - `archived` (bool) – Whether to archive the thread or not.

  - `locked` (bool) – Whether to lock the thread or not.

  - `invitable` (bool) – Whether non-moderators can add other non-moderators to this thread. Only available for private threads.

  - `auto_archive_duration` (int) – The new duration in minutes before a thread is automatically archived for inactivity. Must be one of 60, 1440, 4320, or 10080.

  - `slowmode_delay` (int) – Specifies the slowmode rate limit for user in this thread, in seconds. A value of 0 disables slowmode. The maximum value possible is 21600.

```python
thread = bot.get_channel(id)
await thread.edit(
    name="New Name",
    archived=True,
    locked=True,
    slowmode_delay=10,
    auto_archive_duration=60,
    )
```

As you can see, threads are quite simple. Once you learn how to use them, it's easy to create whatever you want.

## FAQ

### Why am I getting a `Forbidden` error when I try to create a thread?

This is probably because the bot does not have the proper permissions to create a thread. 

### Why am I getting an Unknown Message error when I try to create a thread?

Getting an error looking something like `discord.ext.commands.errors.CommandInvokeError: Command raised an exception: HTTPException: 400 Bad Request (error code: 10008): Unknown Message`?

There could be multiple reasons, some of them being:

- The message does not exist
- The message already has a thread
- The message is in channel x, you are trying to start a thread in channel y.
- The message was deleted.
