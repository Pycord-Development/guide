## About

Subclassing is another popular way of creating Discord Bots. Here, you create a bot by extending a bot class. To some advanced users, this is preferable to creating a bot instance with `bot = discord.Bot()`.

Subclassing is an intermediate python concept, so we recommend you learn about it before continuing. Some good resources are:

- [W3Schools's Guide to Python Classes & Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)
- [W3Schools's Guide to Python Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp)

<!-- ## Basic Example

```python
import discord


class MyBot(discord.Bot):
    async def on_ready(self):
        print('Logged in as')
        print(self.user.name)
        print(self.user.id)
        print('------')

    @slash_command()
    async def ping(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send('Pong!')

bot = MyBot()
bot.run('token')

``` -->
