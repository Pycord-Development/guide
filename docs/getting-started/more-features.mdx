So, you just created your first Pycord bot! Now, let's add some more features to it. This will include adding event handlers, waiting for user response, styling the messages, and more.

## Events

### Event Handlers

Events in Discord are a way to listen for certain actions. For example, if you want to know when a user joins your server so you could send a welcome message, you can use the `on_member_join` event.

First, you need to ask Discord to send you events. This is done via "Intents". Read up the [Intents](../Popular-Topics/intents) page for more information.

Once you understand what intents are, you can enable the events you need, or just use the default ones with `discord.Intents.all()`.

Now that that's done, let's add an event handler for when a user joins the server. We will use the `on_member_join` event. We will send a private message to the user welcoming them to the server.

```python
@bot.event
async def on_member_join(member):
    await member.send(
        f'Welcome to the server, {member.mention}! Enjoy your stay here.'
    )
```

We use the [`discord.Bot.event` decorator](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.event) to add the event handler. 

The `on_member_join` event is called when a user joins the server. The `member` parameter is the user that joined. Different events have different names and parameters. You can find all of them [here](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Intents).

So, that's how you add event handlers!

### Waiting for User Response

Let's say you want to create a Guess-the-Number game (where the user has to guess a number between 1-10). You need to send a message to a user and wait for them to respond. You can do this with the [`wait_for`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.wait_for) method.

```python
@bot.command()
async def gtn(ctx):
    """A Slash Command to play a Guess-the-Number game."""

    await ctx.respond('Guess a number between 1 and 10.')
    guess = await bot.wait_for('message', check=lambda message: message.author == ctx.author)

    if int(guess.content) == 5:
        await ctx.send('You guessed it!')
    else:
        await ctx.send('Nope, try again.')
```

`wait_for` takes one argument, which is the event type. The event type is the name of the event you want to wait for. In this case, it's `message`. It could also be `reaction` to wait for a reaction to be added.

We pass a keyword argument to `wait_for` called `check`. The function may look complicated if you're a beginner. We pass a `lambda` function, which simplifies the code a bit.

The lambda function takes one parameter, `message`. When Pycord receives a message, it passes it to the `check` function. If the function returns `True`, the message is returned. If the function returns `False`, the message is ignored and the bot waits for another message.

Here, we check if the message is from the user that sent the command. We simply use `message.author == ctx.author`. This will check if the author of the message was the person who invoked the command.

## Styling Messages

### Embeds
Embeds are a Discord feature that allows applications to format their messages in cool embedded format,
enabling your bot to lay out messages with a lot of text into neat fields.

Creating embeds is simple! Just create an instance of [`discord.Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed) and edit it to your liking. Once you're done, send it!

```python
import discord

bot = discord.Bot()

@bot.command()
async def hello(ctx):
    embed = discord.Embed(
        title="My Amazing Embed",
        description="Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvinience.",
        color=discord.Colour.blurple(), # Pycord provides a class with default colors you can choose from
    )
    embed.add_field(title="A Normal Field", value="A really nice field with some information. **The description as well as the fields support markdown!**")

    embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 1", value="Inline Field 1", inline=True)
    embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 2", value="Inline Field 2", inline=True)
    embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 3", value="Inline Field 3", inline=True)
 
    embed.set_footer(text="Footer! No markdown here.") # footers can have icons too
    embed.set_author(name="Pycord Team", icon="https://example.com/link-to-my-image.png")
    embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-thumbnail.png")
    embed.set_image(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-banner.png")
 
    await ctx.respond("Hello! Here's a cool embed.", embed=embed) # Send the embed with some text
 
bot.run("TOKEN")
```

                <DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Inline Field 1" inline="true">Inline Field 1</DiscordEmbedField>
                <DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Inline Field 2" inline="true">Inline Field 2</DiscordEmbedField>
                <DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Inline Field 3" inline="true">Inline Field 3</DiscordEmbedField>
            </DiscordEmbedFields>
            <span slot="footer">Footer! No markdown here.</span>
        </DiscordEmbed>

This simple command sends replies to a [slash command](../interactions/application-commands/slash-commands) with an embed.
Let's break it down:
 
```py
embed = discord.Embed(
        title="My Amazing Embed",
        description="Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvinience.",
        color=discord.Colour.blurple(),
    )
```
 
This command creates an embed. We use the [`Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed)
class to create an embed object with the title "My Amazing Embed", the description "Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvinience.", and the color `blurple`, Discord's main theme color.
 
[discord.Colour](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#colour) is a class full of [classmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod)
that return color values. While the official, documented name of this is `discord.Colour`, `discord.Color`
works as well. 
 
```py
embed.add_field(title="A Normal Field", value="A really nice field with some information. **The description as well as the fields support markdown!**")
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 1", value="Inline Field 1", inline=True)
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 2", value="Inline Field 2", inline=True)
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 3", value="Inline Field 3", inline=True)
```
 
This small section shows off embed fields. You can add fields to embeds with the [`add_field` method](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.add_field)
of the [`discord.Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#embed) class. These consist of three 
keyword arguments: `title`, `value`, and `inline`. `title` and `value` are both required arguments, which inline defaults to `False` if it's not defined. The `inline` argument specifies whether or not space will be divided among the inline fields. There could be a mix of fields where inline has different values too.
 
```py
embed.set_footer(text="Footer! No markdown here.") # footers can have icons too
embed.set_author(name="Pycord Team", icon="https://example.com/link-to-my-image.png")
embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-thumbnail.png")
embed.set_image(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-banner.png")
```
 
In this section, we're adding unique items to the embed. These items are:
- Footer - With the [`set_footer()`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_footer)
method, you can set a small footer that holds a message. This has `text` and `icon_url` kwargs.
- Author - With the [`set_author`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_author)
method, you can set an author for the embed. This is a small text field at the top of the embed. This
includes `name`, `url` and `icon_url` kwargs.
- Thumbnail - With the [`set_thumbnial`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_thumbnail)
method, you can set a small image to reside at the top-right of the embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
- Image - With the [`set_image`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_image)
method, you can set an image to sit at the bottom of an embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
 
There are a lot more methods and attributes you can use to configure embeds. Here, we just covered the basics. Also remember that all of these values are not nessesary in an embed. An embed may only contain a few of these, for example, only a description, or a title and a description, and so on.
 
### Markdown
Markdown is a type of markup language that's limited in terms of formatting yet simple. Discord allows
for a watered-down version of markdown to be in their messages. This includes:
 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>*italics*</td>
        <td>__*underlined italics*__</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>**bold**</td> 
        <td>__**underlined bold**__</td>
        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>***bold italics***</td>
        <td>__***underlined bold italics***__</td>
        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>__underlined__</td>
        <td>~~strikethrough~~</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Sadly, Discord does not support other types, such as hyperlinks. The only supported places for hyperlinks are
in embeds and messages sent through webhooks.

Adding markdown to your embeds or messages will give your bot the sparkle it needs.

Here is an example for a hyperlink in embeds.

```
[Click here!](https://pycord.dev/)
```
Inside the embed, the example above will look like this: [`Click here!`](https://pycord.dev/)

:::caution
 
Some embed fields, such as the footer, do not support markdown *at all*, including bold and italics.

#### Code Markdown

For code markdown, you can choose between `Code Text` and `Code Blocks`.

- \`Code Text\`
- \`\`\`
Code Blocks
\`\`\`

Code Blocks support different programming languages, such as Python.

If you start your Code Block with <code>```python</code>, you can send readable Python code to Discord.
