# Markdown
Markdown is a type of markup language that's limited in terms of formatting yet simple. Discord allows
for a watered-down version of markdown to be in their messages.

## Text Markdown

Text formatting can be used in messages and in most embed parts,
as explained in the dedicated section below.
 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>*italics*</td>
        <td>__*underlined italics*__</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>**bold**</td>
        <td>__**underlined bold**__</td>
        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>***bold italics***</td>
        <td>__***underlined bold italics***__</td>
        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>__underlined__</td>
        <td>~~strikethrough~~</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Code Markdown

This formatting can be used not only for code but also for normal text,
when you want the text to have a different background or to be encased in a box.

### Single-Line Code Block

To create a single-line code block without syntax highlight, wrap the text between single backticks.
This code block will only add a dark background to the text.

```text
`print("Hello world!")`
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
`print("Hello world!")`
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

### Multi-Line Code Block

This type of code block, created by using triple backticks, will encase the text inside a box.

#### Without Syntax Highlight

To create a multi-line code block without syntax highlight, wrap the text between triple backticks
on first and last line.

````text
```
message = "Hello world!"
print(message)
```
````

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
```
message = "Hello world!"
print(message)
```
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

#### With Syntax Highlight

To create a multi-line block with syntax highlight, add the name of the language you are using right after
the triple backticks on the first line. For example, for Python you can write either "python" or "py".

````
```python
message = "Hello world!"
print(message)
```
````

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
```python
message = "Hello world!"
print(message)
```
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

### Single-Line Code Block

If you want to use syntax highlight for a single line of code, you still have to format it
like a multi-line block, however, you cannot start writing the encased text on the same line
where you declare which language to use.

````
```python
print("Hello world!")
```
````

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
```python
print("Hello world!")
```
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

## Quote Markdown

### Single-Line Quote Block

To create a single-line quote block, start the line with `>` followed by a space.

```text
> This is a single-line quote.
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
> This is a single-line quote.
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

### Multi-Line Quote Block

To create a multi-line quote block, write `>>>` followed by a space. All text
from that point onwards will be included in that quote block.

```text
>>> This is a
multi-line quote.
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
>>> This is a
multi-line quote.
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

## Spoiler Markdown

To hide a spoiler, encase the text between double pipes. The users
will have to click on it before being able to see the text contained in it.

```
||spoiler||
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <DiscordMarkdown>
||spoiler||
    </DiscordMarkdown>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

## Link Markdown

Link formatting only works in messages sent through webhooks end embeds,
by using the following syntax:

```
[Pycord](https://pycord.dev/)
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <a href={"https://pycord.dev/"}>Pycord</a>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br/>

Inside the supported elements that have just been mentioned,
the example above will create a link with the text `Pycord` and the URL `https://pycord.dev/`.
Outside of them, the link will still be clickable but the formatting will be ignored.

## Embed Markdown
 
Adding markdown to your embeds or messages will give your bot the sparkle it needs,
however, markdown is limited inside embeds. Use the following table as a reference
and keep in mind that embed title and filed names will always show in **bold**.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Part</th>
    <th>Text</th>
    <th>Link</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Embed Author</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Embed Title</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Embed Description</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Field Name</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Field Value</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Embed Footer</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
