# Embeds

Embeds are a Discord feature that allows applications to format their messages in cool embedded format,
enabling your bot to lay out messages with a lot of text into neat fields.

Creating embeds is simple! Just create an instance of [`discord.Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed) and edit it to your liking. Once you're done, send it!

```python
import discord

bot = discord.Bot()

@bot.command()
async def hello(ctx):
    embed = discord.Embed(
        title="My Amazing Embed",
        description="Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvenience.",
        color=discord.Colour.blurple(), # Pycord provides a class with default colors you can choose from
    )
    embed.add_field(name="A Normal Field", value="A really nice field with some information. **The description as well as the fields support markdown!**")

    embed.add_field(name="Inline Field 1", value="Inline Field 1", inline=True)
    embed.add_field(name="Inline Field 2", value="Inline Field 2", inline=True)
    embed.add_field(name="Inline Field 3", value="Inline Field 3", inline=True)
 
    embed.set_footer(text="Footer! No markdown here.") # footers can have icons too
    embed.set_author(name="Pycord Team", icon_url="https://example.com/link-to-my-image.png")
    embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-thumbnail.png")
    embed.set_image(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-banner.png")
 
    await ctx.respond("Hello! Here's a cool embed.", embed=embed) # Send the embed with some text
 
bot.run("TOKEN")
```

<DiscordComponent>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>hello</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        Hello! Here's a cool embed.
        <DiscordEmbed

        authorName="Pycord Team"
        authorUrl="https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide"
        thumbnail="/img/logo.png"
        borderColor="#5865F2"

This simple command sends replies to a [slash command](../../interactions/application-commands/slash-commands) with an embed.
Let's break it down:
 
```py
embed = discord.Embed(
        title="My Amazing Embed",
        description="Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvenience.",
        color=discord.Colour.blurple(),
    )
```
 
This command creates an embed. We use the [`Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed)
class to create an embed object with the title "My Amazing Embed", the description "Embeds are super easy, barely an inconvenience.", and the color `blurple`, Discord's main theme color.
 
[discord.Colour](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#colour) is a class full of [classmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod)
that return color values. While the official, documented name of this is `discord.Colour`, `discord.Color`
works as well. 
 
```py
embed.add_field(title="A Normal Field", value="A really nice field with some information. **The description as well as the fields support markdown!**")
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 1", value="Inline Field 1", inline=True)
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 2", value="Inline Field 2", inline=True)
embed.add_field(title="Inline Field 3", value="Inline Field 3", inline=True)
```
 
This small section shows off embed fields. You can add up to 25 fields to embeds with the [`add_field` method](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.add_field)
of the [`discord.Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#embed) class. These consist of three 
keyword arguments: `title`, `value`, and `inline`. `title` and `value` are both required arguments, whereas `inline` is optional and defaults to `False` when not defined. The `inline` argument specifies whether or not space will be divided among the inline fields. There could be a mix of fields where inline has different values too.
 
```py
embed.set_footer(text="Footer! No markdown here.") # footers can have icons too
embed.set_author(name="Pycord Team", icon_url="https://example.com/link-to-my-image.png")
embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-thumbnail.png")
embed.set_image(url="https://example.com/link-to-my-banner.png")
```
 
In this section, we're adding unique items to the embed. These items are:
-   Footer - With the [`set_footer()`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_footer)
method, you can set a small footer that holds a message. This has `text` and `icon_url` kwargs.
-   Author - With the [`set_author`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_author)
method, you can set an author for the embed. This is a small text field at the top of the embed. This
includes `name`, `url` and `icon_url` kwargs.
-   Thumbnail - With the [`set_thumbnail`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_thumbnail)
method, you can set a small image to reside at the top-right of the embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
-   Image - With the [`set_image`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_image)
method, you can set an image to sit at the bottom of an embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
 
There are a lot more methods and attributes you can use to configure embeds. Here, we just covered the basics. Also, remember that all of these values are not necessary in an embed. An embed may only contain a few of these. For example, only a description, a title and a description, and so on.
