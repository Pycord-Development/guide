# Events

## Event Handlers

Events in Discord are a way to listen for certain actions. For example, if you want to know when a user joins your server so you could send a welcome message, you can use the `on_member_join` event.

First, you need to ask Discord to send you events. This is done via "Intents". Read up the [Intents](../Popular-Topics/intents) page for more information.

Once you understand what intents are, you can enable the events you need, or just use the default ones with `discord.Intents.all()`.

Now that that's done, let's add an event handler for when a user joins the server. We will use the [`on_member_join` event](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.on_member_join). We will send a private message to the user welcoming them to the server.

```python
@bot.event
async def on_member_join(member):
    await member.send(
        f'Welcome to the server, {member.mention}! Enjoy your stay here.'
    )
```

We use the [`discord.Bot.event` decorator](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.event) to add the event handler. 

The `on_member_join` event is called when a user joins the server. The `member` parameter is the user that joined. Different events have different names and parameters. You can find all of them [here](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Intents).

So, that's how you add event handlers!

## Waiting for User Response

Let's say you want to create a Guess-the-Number game (where the user has to guess a number between 1-10). You need to send a message to a user and wait for them to respond. You can do this with the [`wait_for`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.wait_for) method.

```python
@bot.command()
async def gtn(ctx):
    """A Slash Command to play a Guess-the-Number game."""

    await ctx.respond('Guess a number between 1 and 10.')
    guess = await bot.wait_for('message', check=lambda message: message.author == ctx.author)

    if int(guess.content) == 5:
        await ctx.send('You guessed it!')
    else:
        await ctx.send('Nope, try again.')
```

`wait_for` takes one argument, which is the event type. The event type is the name of the event you want to wait for. In this case, it's `message`. It could also be `reaction` to wait for a reaction to be added.

We pass a keyword argument to `wait_for` called `check`. The function may look complicated if you're a beginner. We pass a `lambda` function, which simplifies the code a bit.

The lambda function takes one parameter, `message`. When Pycord receives a message, it passes it to the `check` function. If the function returns `True`, the message is returned. If the function returns `False`, the message is ignored and the bot waits for another message.

Here, we check if the message is from the user that sent the command. We simply use `message.author == ctx.author`. This will check if the author of the message was the person who invoked the command.
