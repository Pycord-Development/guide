Pycord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. Pycord is a maintained fork of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Before you begin

Pycord is an advanced and complex Python library. To take advantage of the full capabilities of Pycord, you will need to have a good understanding of Python. You should know the basics of Python and have an understanding of the following concepts:

-   Variables
-   Data Types
-   Functions
-   Packages
-   Conditionals
-   Loops
-   Classes
-   Object-Oriented Programming
-   Inheritance
-   Exception Handling
-   Iterators
-   Coroutines
-   Async/Await

This list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a good idea of what you need to know to get started.

When you see an ellipsis - that's the three dots - in this guide, it is a placeholder for code that you need to fill in. Sometimes, it may be code for a command, while other times it could be something simple like a Guild ID. Make sure to replace them before running your bot!
