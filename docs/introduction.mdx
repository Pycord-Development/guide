Pycord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. Pycord is a maintained fork of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Before you begin

Pycord is an advanced and complex Python library. To take advantage of the full capabilities of Pycord, you will need to have a good understanding of Python. You should know the basics of Python and have an understanding of the following concepts:

-   Variables
-   Data Types
-   Functions
-   Packages
-   Conditionals
-   Loops
-   Classes
-   Object-Oriented Programming
-   Inheritance
-   Exception Handling
-   Iterators
-   Coroutines
-   Async/Await

This list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a good idea of what you need to know to get started.

When you see an ellipsis - that's the three dots - in this guide, it is a placeholder for code that you need to fill in. Sometimes, it may be code for a command, while other times it could be something simple like a Guild ID. Make sure to replace them before running your bot!

## Credits

First of all, we would like to thank [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz) for the original [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py) library. Pycord is a maintained fork of this library.

We would also like to thank the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide), which inspired this guide style-wise, and the now defunct [original Pycord Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813041929/https://namantech.me/pycord/), which inspired some content in this guide.

We created this guide using [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io), a modern static site generator for React. We would also like to thank Danktuary for his [`@discord-message-components/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discord-message-components/react) package, from which we took the Discord message components.

And finally, we would like to thank the amazing and loving community of Pycord users, contributors and developers.
