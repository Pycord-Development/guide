description: Learn how to set up a virtual environment for Pycord.

## Setup
Sometimes you want to keep libraries from polluting system installs or use a different version of libraries than the ones installed on the system. You might also not have permissions to install libraries system-wide. For this purpose, the standard library as of Python 3.3 comes with a concept called “Virtual Environment”s to help maintain these separate versions.

A more in-depth tutorial is found on [Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

However, for the quick and dirty:

Go to your project’s working directory:

```bash
$ cd your-bot-source
$ python3 -m venv bot-env
```
Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
$ source bot-env/bin/activate
```
On Windows you activate it with:

```batch
$ bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
Use pip like usual:

```bash
$ pip install -U py-cord
```
Congratulations. You now have a virtual environment all set up.

## Additional info
It can be useful to set up a requirements.txt so you can just put all of your dependencies in there and have pip install it.
For instance, if you wanted to have the latest 2.0 version of pycord and [pytz](https://github.com/stub42/pytz/blob/master/src/README.rst), just create a file named requirements.txt with the following contents:

```
py-cord>=2.0.0
pytz
```
And then (in your virtual environment) you can just execute
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To keep from committing your virtual environment to git, you can set up a .gitignore file with the following line
(assuming you named your virtual environment bot-env like the above example):
```
bot-env/
```
