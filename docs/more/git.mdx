Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files (also known as a "version control" software), usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Let's see how to install Git on different platforms.

## Windows

On Windows, Git can be installed via:

- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)
- [Git Scm](https://git-scm.com/download/windows)

## Linux

On Linux, Git is probably already installed in your distribution's repository. If not, you can install it via [Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux). You can also install it via the built-in package manager on your Linux distro.

## Mac

You can install Git for your macOS computer via [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). Alternatively, it can be also be installed from the Xcode Command Line Tools by installing Xcode from the App Store, or by running this:
