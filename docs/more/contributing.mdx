This page outlines some of the basic syntax you need to know to contribute to the guide. We recommend you also check out:

- [Docusaurus's Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/)
- [Contributing Rules](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Info

We use [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/) to generate our guide. All of the guide pages are generated
from `mdx` files in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide/tree/master/docs) directory.
MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

## Markdown Syntax

This page quickly outlines some of the syntax that is used in markdown.

````md
Markdown syntax is pretty easy. You can add **bold**, _italic_ and _underline_ text. You can use ~~strikethrough~~. You can use `inline code blocks`.

    ```python
    print("We can use code blocks like this.")
    ```

You can add [links to other websites](https://pycord.dev). You can add images by adding ![alt text](https://pycord.dev/image.png).

- You can create
- unordered lists like this

1. Or ordered lists
2. Like this

3. If you want markdown to automatically detect what number you are on, you can use `1.`
4. Like this

# Headers

## Go

#### This

You can even use HTML in Markdown.

<samp>This text is monospaced</samp>
Use <br/> to add a break line.

> We can use blockquotes too.

2 ways to create tables:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header</th>
        <th>Header</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell</td>
        <td>Cell</td>
    </tr>
</table>

| Header | Header |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cell   | Cell   |

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two new lines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.

We can use emojis too! :joy:

- [x] We can have task lists too
- [ ] This is a task
- [ ] That's not done yet

## Admonitions

We can add warnings, notes, etc. with the following syntax:

```md
:::note

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

:::tip

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

:::info

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

:::caution

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

:::danger

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

:::important

Remember that it's `:::important`, not `::: important` with a space!

:::
```

<details>
<summary>Preview</summary>
<div class="markdown-body">

:::

:::tip Cool Stuff

You can edit an admonition's title by adding text after the `:::` and name, like this!

</details>

## Discord Message Components

As most files already have the imports for these, it's not that hard to add them.
The div starts like so:

```md
<DiscordMessages>

</DiscordMessages>

<br />
```

This is where you list a `DiscordMessage`.

```md
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
        Hello!
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />
```

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
    Hello!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

It has a pretty straightforward syntax.

:::tip

Add a `<br/>` to the end of a component to make it spaced out from the text below it.

### Slash Commands

To make a message authored by a slash command, do the following:

```md
<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Guide Man"
        avatar="green"
        command
      >
        update
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Updated dependencies to the latest version!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
```

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Guide Man"
        avatar="green"
        command
      >
        update
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Updated dependencies to the latest version!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

### Buttons

To make a message with buttons, do the following:

```mdx
<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Guide Man"
        avatar="green"
        command
      >
        work
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Work Done!
    <div slot="actions">
      <DiscordButtons>
        <DiscordButton type="primary">Rest</DiscordButton>
        <DiscordButton type="secondary">Sleep</DiscordButton>
      </DiscordButtons>
    </div>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
```

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Guide Man"
        avatar="green"
        command
      >
        work
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Work Done!
    <div slot="actions">
      <DiscordButtons>
        <DiscordButton type="primary">Rest</DiscordButton>
        <DiscordButton type="secondary">Sleep</DiscordButton>
      </DiscordButtons>
    </div>
