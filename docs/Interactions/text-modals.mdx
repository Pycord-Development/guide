# Text Modals

Text modals, also known as "modals" or "text inputs", are Discord's answer for getting text input from
users. Instead of waiting for someone to send a message, bots can now wait for someone to fill out a 
form that gets returned to the bot. 

Modals are one of the latest interactions from Discord, being released due to the upcoming
[Message Content Privileged Intent](../Popular-Topics/intents). Soon, this will be the only way for
bots that aren't whitelisted for this intent to get text input, other than direct messages and bot
mentions. The following is an example of a text modal.

```py title = "Text Modal Example"
class MyModal(Modal):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.add_item(InputText(label="Short Input", placeholder="Placeholder Test"))

        self.add_item(
            InputText(
                label="Longer Input",
                value="Longer Value\nSuper Long Value",
                style=discord.InputTextStyle.long,
            )
        )

    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Your Modal Results", color=discord.Color.random())
        embed.add_field(name="First Input", value=self.children[0].value, inline=False)
        embed.add_field(name="Second Input", value=self.children[1].value, inline=False)
        await interaction.response.send_message(embeds=[embed])


@bot.slash_command(name="modaltest", guild_ids=[...])
async def modal_slash(ctx):
    """Shows an example of a modal dialog being invoked from a slash command."""
    modal = MyModal(title="Slash Command Modal")
    await ctx.send_modal(modal)
```
        
[This example](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/blob/master/examples/modal_dialogs.py) was
taken straight from Pycord's [examples page](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/tree/master/examples).
This page provides tons of very useful examples that you should definitely check out.

Now, let's break down the code:

```py
class MyModal(Modal):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.add_item(InputText(label="Short Input", placeholder="Placeholder Test"))
```

Here is where we define the modal. Here, we use the [`super()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super)
function to initialize the superclass, [`discord.ui.Modal`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Modal).
We also use the [`add_item` function](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Modal.add_item)
of the current instance to add a text field to our modal. Text fields are represented by 
[`discord.ui.InputText`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#inputtext), where we pass the arguments
`label` and `placeholder`.

```py
        self.add_item(
            InputText(
                label="Longer Input",
                value="Longer Value\nSuper Long Value",
                style=discord.InputTextStyle.long,
            )
        )
```

Here, we also add an item. This shows off how you can expand the function to make it more readable.
It also passes in a new `style` kwarg, which allows us to choose what type of style we want with
`discord.InputTextStyle`, which can either be `short` or `long`.

```py
    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction):
        embed = discord.Embed(title="Your Modal Results", color=discord.Color.random())
        embed.add_field(name="First Input", value=self.children[0].value, inline=False)
        embed.add_field(name="Second Input", value=self.children[1].value, inline=False)
        await interaction.response.send_message(embeds=[embed])
```

Here, we overwrite `discord.ui.Modal`'s [`callback function`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Modal.callback),
which takes both `self` and [`discord.Interaction`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Interaction)
as arguments.

We use `self.children` to get the user's input by choosing an index and using the `value` attribute.

In this callback, we simply create an embed that includes all of the modal's values and sends it
with [`interaction.response.send_message()`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.InteractionResponse.send_message).
Of course, you can do almost anything inside of this callback. You can process the input and insert it
into a database, you can process the input to parse as a choice for something, and more!

## InputTextStyle

InputTextStyle is an enum that is used to refer to the style of a text input field in modals.
There are five ways to refer to a style, though only two actual styles.

```
short = 1
singleline = 1
paragraph = 2
multiline = 2
long = 2
```

These are what can be refered to when choosing a style. `1` refers to a short or single line input,
while `2` regers to a long or milti-line input.
