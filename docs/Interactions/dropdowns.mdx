title: Select Menus

# About

On [Insert date], Discord added their second message component: Select Menus. Select Menus allow users
to choose from a list of items sent by a bot. These are a great substitute for having a user send a
number that corresponds to an option. You can even allow users to select multiple options from Select
Menus. This guide will show you the easy and painless ways of using them with Pycord.

## Concept

Select Menus aren't the only message component in Discord. There are also [Buttons](buttons) and
[Text Modals](modals). Select Menus make it easy for users to pick one or multiple options from
a list provided by a bot.

```py
class MyView(discord.ui.View):

    @discord.ui.select(
        placeholder = "Choose a Flavor!",
        min_values = 1,
        max_values = 1,
        options = [
            discord.SelectOption(
                label="Vanilla",
                description="Pick this if you like vanilla!"
            ),
            discord.SelectOption(
                label="Chocolate",
                description="Pick this if you like chocolate!"
            ),
            discord.SelectOption(
                label="Strawberry",
                description="Pick this if you like strawberry!"
            )
        ]
    )
    async def select_callback(self, select, callback):
        await interaction.respond.send_message(f"Awesome! I like {self.values[0]} too!")
```

This is a basic example of a Select Menu. Let's go over the code:

```py
class MyView(discord.ui.View):
```

This defines the view. When sending the message, this would go in the `view` kwarg, like so:

```py
await ctx.send("Select Menus rock!", view=view)
```

This would send a message that reads "Select Menus rock!" along with the view.

```py
@discord.ui.select(
    placeholder = "Choose a Flavor!",
    min_values = 1,
    max_values = 1,
    options = [
        discord.SelectOption(
            label="Vanilla",
            description="Pick this if you like vanilla!"
        ),
        discord.SelectOption(
            label="Chocolate",
            description="Pick this if you like chocolate!"
        ),
        discord.SelectOption(
            label="Strawberry",
            description="Pick this if you like strawberry!"
        )
    ]
)
```

This is a big section, and it's only the decorator! Don't worry, though, it's very simple.

- `pleaceholder` is what goes in the select before any value is selected.
- `min_values` is the minimum amount of values a user has to choose.
- `max_values` is the maximum amount of values a user can choose.
- `options` is a list of discord.SelectOption objects that make up a Select Menu Option.
  - `label` in a Select Option is the label of the option.
  - `description` in a Select Option is the description of the option.

Not so bad, was it?

```py
async def select_callback(self, select, callback):
    await interaction.respond.send_message(f"Awesome! I like {self.values[0]} too!")
```

Finally, the callback. This is what the Select Menu actually _does_ after being used. In this case,
it responds to the interactions with "Awesome! I like {The option you chose} too!"

Once again, if you found any of these very hard to understand, we suggest freshening up your Python
skills, as Pycord requires a bit of Python experience.
