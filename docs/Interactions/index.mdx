Back in the December 2020, Discord released their first interaction: the slash command. 
Since then, Discord has added and updated Interactions a lot. Different types of Interactions are:

__**Message Components**__

- **Buttons**: buttons that can be clicked on to perform an action
- **Select Menus**: Dropdowns used to select an option from a list of options
- **Modals**: Form-like modals that can be used to ask for input

__**Application Commands**__

- **Slash Commands**: Commands that can be used to perform an action
- **Context Menu Commands**
  - **User Commands:** Commands that can be used *on* a user by right clicking/selecting them
  - **Message Commands:** Commands that can be used on a message by right clicking/selecting it


## Message Components

Message Components are fairly new features in Discord, allowing developers to give their bots a fast 
and understandable user interface. Message Components are easy to use and make your bot look modern,
sleek, and downright awesome.

### Views

Views are not an Application Command nor are they a Message Component. Views are the invisible
placeholders or grid that Message Components lie in. Views can have up to 5 `Action Rows`. `Action
Rows` can have a maximum of 5 slots. Below you can find a table of how many slots a Message 
Interaction takes up.

| Component    | Slots                        |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| Buttons      | 1 Slot                       |
| Select Menus | 5 Slots                      |
| Text Modals  | 1 Slot (opened via a button) |

So, based on this, you could have a maximum of 25 buttons in a View with no Select Menus and 5 Select
Menus with no Buttons in a View. This doesn't mean you can't have them both in a View. You can have
a combination, such as 20 Buttons and a Select Menu or 10 Buttons and 3 Select Menus. 

### Buttons

Buttons are the first of the Message Components. They allow for quick responses to prompts, such as 
a "cancel" or "continue" button. Of course, these aren't the only uses. People have created awesome
things with buttons, such as calculators, games, and more!

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    Discord buttons are awesome!
    <div slot="actions">
      <DiscordButtons>
        <DiscordButton type="primary">ðŸ˜Ž Click me!</DiscordButton>
      </DiscordButtons>
    </div>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br/>

This is what a Button looks like. Very simple and modern. To learn more about buttons, refer to our
(buttons page)[buttons.mdx].

### Select Menus

Select Menus are the second of Discord's Message Components. They allow for quick choices by the
user that your bot can use. Select Menus are good for things such as choosing features, pages of a 
help menu, and more.

[Insert Select Menu example]

This is what a Select Menu looks like. While not looking as good as Buttons, they still look great
and have even greater possibilities. To learn more about Select Menus, please refer to our (Select
Menus page)[dropdowns.mdx].

### Text Modals

Text Modals are the most recent Message Component in Discord. They're useful for text input and
filling out forms such as a sign-up for your bot's service. These are meant to replace long bot setup
processes by allowing users to fill out a form, as well as replace having to make the user send 
messages that the bot uses in general. Due to the upcoming (Message Content Intent)[topics/intents.mdx],
verified bots will be forced to use Discord's new interactions system instead of messages. Text Modals
are opened by clicking on a button.

This is what a Text Modal looks like. Easy to use and one of the most useful Message Components yet.


### Views

Views are not an Application Command nor are they a Message Component. Views are the invisible
placeholders or grid that Message Components lie in. Views can have up to 5 `Action Rows`. `Action
Rows` can have a maximum of 5 slots. Below you can find a table of how many slots a Message 
Interaction takes up.

| Component    | Slots                        |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Buttons      | 1 Slot                       |
| Select Menus | 5 Slots                      |
| Text Modals  | 1 Slot (opened via a button) |

So, based on this, you could have a maximum of 25 buttons in a View with no Select Menus and 5 Select
Menus with no Buttons in a View. This doesn't mean you can't have them both in a View. You can have
a combination, such as 20 Buttons and a Select Menu or 10 Buttons and 3 Select Menus. 

## Application Commands

Application Commands are also a new feature to Discord that allow easier ways to use commands
that don't compromise Discord safety and privacy. Application Commands are easy to add to your bot
and give users an easier and safer way to use commands.

### Slash Commands

Slash Commands were the first Discord Interaction. Slash Commands are easy to use and create. They
allow for an alternative to prefix commands without the need for the message content intent.

:::note

Preferring prefix commands over Application Commands are **not** a valid reason to apply for the
message content Privileged Intent. Using this as a reason will get your application denied.

:::

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>
        ping
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Pong! Latency is 335ms.
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

This is what a slash command looks like. Very simple, not very different from a normal command other
than the note telling you who used the command. Slash Commands support fields for the following:

- Members
- Roles
- Attachments
- Text

Just about as good as it gets.

### Message and User Commands

Message Commands and User Commands were both introduced around the same time, and are very similar to
each other, so we'll be introducing them together. These commands are found in the `apps` tab when
alt-clicking. The only difference between the two is that Message Commands only appear in the apps tab
of a message, while User Commands are only found in the apps tab of a user. Message Commands are
useful for having function to report a message, warn a user for that message, and more. User Commands
are useful for having a function to add a user to a ticket, warn a user, and more.

This is a Message Command:

And this is a User Command:

Pretty cool, right? To learn more about these two, please read the (Message and User Commands guide)

## Application Commands vs. Prefix Commands

Ever since Discord was created, apps on it have used prefixes. This means that you'd have to put a 
certain character or string of characters in front of your command, such as `!ping`. The way this 
worked was that your bot listened for messages and picked out the ones that had its prefix, and then
responded with the command. Now, Discord is forcing developers to switch their applications to
`Application Commands`, a new system meant to preserve the privacy and safety of Discord's users. But 
why exactly is Discord making us switch? What's the better option, Application Commands or prefix
commands? Following discusses everything you need to know.

### Discord's Decision

You should be familiar with Discord scams by now, right? The links people send in DMs and servers 
telling you it's Nitro or a game them and their friends have been working on, only to get not Nitro
or a neat Indie game, but to get booted off of Discord and your account information changed. These
are very common on Discord, and they still aren't under control. Discord is doing everything in their
power to stop it, and this includes using Application Commands rather than prefix commands.

Prefix commands work by reading messages, as described before. Application Commands, however, don't
work this way. Application Commands work by Discord sending your bot information for when a command
was used. This way, Discord can limit message reading to only bots that absolutely depend on it, such
as auto moderation bots. 

### Who has to Use Application Commands

Any verified bot without a reason that Discord deems acceptable must use Application Commands. Discord
is allowing applications for the Message Content intent, but they're being picky about it and won't
approve bots that simply *prefer* prefix commands. So, if your bot doesn't have an automoderator,
message detector, or anything that reads messages, you're out of luck.

Unverified bots, however, don't have to use Application Commands. This is because the Message Content
intent is a `Privileged Intent`, meaning that you must apply for it and it only needs to be applied
for if your bot is verified or going to be verified. Unverified bots don't have to apply for intents
until they need to get verified, so they can use Privileged Intents freely.

So if your bot is for a couple of servers, you can use prefix commands. If you plan on going somewhere
with your bot, it'll have to use Application Commands.

### What's the Better Option

At the beginning, when slash commands and the Message Content intent were being announced, developers
*hated* it. There were complaints everywhere. At the time, slash commands were thought to be clunky,
slow, and inefficient. Since then, more Application Commands have been introduced and fixes to
them have been applied. Slash commands aren't as terrible as when they first came out, and they
now even support attachements. 

What's truly the better option is up to you as a developer. But, there isn't really an option. If
you plan on growing your bot, you have to use Application Commands. Developers with bigger bots don't
have a choice, so we'll just have to get used to it.
