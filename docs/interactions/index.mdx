import DiscordComponent from "../../src/components/DiscordComponent";

In December 2020, Discord released their first interaction: the
[slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#slash-commands).
Since then, Discord has added and updated Interactions a lot. Different types of Interactions include:

[**Message Components**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components)

- [**Buttons**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#buttons):
Buttons are attached to a message and can be clicked on to perform an action.
- [**Select Menus**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#select-menus):
Drop-down menus are used to select a few options from a list.
- [**Modals**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#text-inputs):
Form-like modals can be used to ask for input from a user.

[**Application Commands**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands)

- [**Slash Commands**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#slash-commands):
Commands that can be used with the `/` prefix.
- **Context Menu Commands**:
Commands that can be used from the right-click menu.
  - [**User Commands**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#user-commands):
  Commands that can be used on a user by Alt-clicking/selecting on them.
  - [**Message Commands**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#message-commands):
   Commands that can be used on a message by Alt-clicking/selecting on it.

## Message Components

Message Components are fairly new features in Discord, allowing developers to give their bots a fast
and understandable user interface. Message Components are easy to use and make your bot look modern,
sleek, and downright awesome.

### [Views](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.View)

Views are not an Application Command nor are they a Message Component. Views are the invisible
placeholders or grid that Message Components lie in. Views can have up to 5 
[`Action Rows`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ActionRow). `Action 
Rows` can have a maximum of 5 slots. Below you can find a table of how many slots a Message
Interaction takes up.

| Component    | Slots                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Buttons      | 1 Slot                       |
| Select Menus | 5 Slots                      |
| Text Modals  | 1 Slot (opened via a button) |

So, based on this, you could have a maximum of 25 buttons in a View with no Select Menus and 5 Select
Menus with no Buttons in a View. This doesn't mean you can't have them both in a View. You can have
a combination, such as 20 Buttons and a Select Menu or 10 Buttons and 3 Select Menus.

### [Buttons](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Button)

Buttons are the first of the Message Components. They allow for quick responses to prompts, such as
a "cancel" or "continue" button. Of course, these aren't the only uses. People have created awesome
things with buttons, such as calculators, games, and more!

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    Discord buttons are awesome!
    <div slot="actions">
      <DiscordButtons>
        <DiscordButton type="primary" emoji="😎">Click me!</DiscordButton>
      </DiscordButtons>
    </div>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br />

This is what a Button looks like. Very simple and modern. To learn more about buttons, refer to our
[buttons page](./ui-components/buttons).

### [Select Menus](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Select)

Select Menus are the second of Discord's Message Components. They allow for quick choices by the
user that your bot can use. Select Menus are good for things such as choosing features, pages of a
help menu, and more.

![Select Menu Example Image](../assets/interactions/select-menus-example.png)

This is what a Select Menu looks like. While not looking as good as Buttons, they still look great
and have even greater possibilities. To learn more about Select Menus, please refer to our [Select
Menus page](./ui-components/dropdowns).

### [Text Modals](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.ui.Modal)

Text Modals are the most recent Message Component in Discord. They're useful for text input and
filling out forms such as a sign-up for your bot's service. These are meant to replace long bot setup
processes by allowing users to fill out a form, as well as replace having to make the user send
messages that the bot uses in general. Due to the upcoming [Message Content Intent](../Popular-Topics/intents),
verified bots will be forced to use Discord's new interactions system instead of messages. Text Modals
are opened by clicking on a button.

![Text Modal Example Image](../assets/interactions/modal-example.png)

This is what a Text Modal looks like. Easy to use and one of the most useful Message Components yet. To
learn more about text modals, please visit our [Modal Dialogs page](./ui-components/modal-dialogs)

## Application Commands

Application Commands are also a new feature to Discord that allow easier ways to use commands
that don't compromise Discord safety and privacy. Application Commands are easy to add to your bot
and give users an easier and safer way to use commands.

### [Slash Commands](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#slashcommand)

Slash Commands were the first Discord Interaction. Slash Commands are easy to use and create. They
allow for an alternative to prefix commands without the need for the message content intent.

:::note

Preferring prefix commands over Application Commands is **not** a valid reason to apply for the
message content Privileged Intent. Using this as a reason will get your application denied.

:::

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction profile="bob" command>
        ping
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Pong! Latency is 335ms.
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br />

This is what a slash command looks like. Very simple, not very different from a normal command other
apart from the note telling you who used the command. Slash Commands support fields for the following:

- Members
- Roles
- Channels
- Attachments
- Text

Just about as good as it gets.

### [Message](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#messagecommand) and [User](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#usercommand) Commands

Message Commands and User Commands were both introduced around the same time, and are very similar to
each other, so we'll be introducing them together. These commands are found in the `apps` tab when
alt-clicking. The only difference between the two is that Message Commands only appear in the apps tab
of a message, while User Commands are only found in the apps tab of a user. Message Commands are
useful for having a function to report a message, warn a user for that message, and more. Whereas User Commands
are useful for having a function to add a user to a ticket, warn a user, and more.

Here's an example of a Message Command:

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="bob">
    Hello World!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction author="Other Guide Man" avatar="orange" contextMenu>
        Reverse Message
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Message 930650407917748286 reversed is "!dlroW olleH"
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br />

And here's an example of a User Command:

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="bob">
    Other Guide Man has been on Discord for a long time
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Other Guide Man"
        avatar="orange"
        contextMenu
      >
        User Age
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Other Guide Man is 1 week old.
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Other Guide Man"
        avatar="orange"
        contextMenu
      >
        User Age
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Guide Man is 40 years old.
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

<br />

Pretty cool, right? To learn more about these two, please read the [Context Menus guide](./Application-Commands/context-menus)

## [Application Commands](#application-commands) vs. [Prefix Commands](../extensions/commands/prefixed-commands)

Ever since Discord was created, apps on it have used prefixes. This means that you'd have to put a
certain character or string of characters in front of your command, such as `!ping`. The way this
worked was that your bot listened for messages and picked out the ones that had their prefix, and then
responded with the command. Now, Discord is forcing developers to switch their applications to
Application Commands, a new system meant to preserve the privacy and safety of Discord's users. But
why exactly is Discord making us switch? What's the better option, Application Commands or prefix
commands? Below we discuss everything you need to know.

### Discord's Decision

You should be familiar with [Discord scams](https://discord.com/blog/common-scams-what-to-look-out-for)
by now, right? The links people send in DMs and servers telling you it's Nitro or a game they and
their friends have been working on, only to get not Nitro or a neat Indie game, but to get booted off
of Discord and your account information changed. These are very common on Discord, and they still
aren't under control. Discord is doing everything in its power to stop it, and this includes using
Application Commands rather than prefix commands.

Prefix commands work by reading messages, as described before. Application Commands, however, don't
work this way. Application Commands work by Discord sending your bot information for when a command
was used. This way, Discord can limit message reading to only bots that _absolutely_ depend on it, such
as auto-moderation bots.

### Who has to Use Application Commands

Any verified bot without a reason that Discord deems acceptable must use Application Commands. Discord
is allowing applications for the Message Content intent, but they're being picky about it and won't
approve bots that simply _prefer_ prefix commands. So, if your bot doesn't have an automoderator,
message detector, or anything that reads messages, you're out of luck.

Unverified bots, however, don't have to use Application Commands. This is because the Message Content
intent is a `Privileged Intent`, meaning that you must apply for it and it only needs to be applied
for if your bot is verified or going to be verified. Unverified bots don't have to apply for intents
until they need to get verified, so they can use Privileged Intents freely.

So if your bot is for a couple of servers, you can use prefix commands. If you plan on going somewhere
with your bot, it'll have to use Application Commands.

### What's the Better Option

In the beginning, when slash commands and the Message Content intent were being announced, developers
_hated_ it. There were complaints everywhere. At the time, slash commands were thought to be clunky,
slow, and inefficient. Since then, more Application Commands have been introduced and fixes to
them have been applied. Slash commands aren't as terrible as when they first came out, and they
now even support attachments.

What's truly the better option is up to you as a developer. But, there isn't really an option. If
you plan on growing your bot, you have to use Application Commands. Developers with bigger bots don't
have a choice, so we'll just have to get used to it.
