import {
  DiscordButton,
  DiscordButtons,
  DiscordInteraction,
  DiscordMessage,

When you right-click a message, you may see an option called "Apps". Hover over it and you can see
commands a bot can run with that message. These are called message commands.

When you right-click a message in the user list, you can once again see an option called "Apps". 
Hover over it and you can see commands a bot can run with that message. These are called user commands.

Together, these two are called Context Menus or Context Menu Commands.

## User Commands

Creating a user command is very simple.

```python
@bot.user_command(name="Account Creation Date", guild_ids=[...])  # create a user command for the supplied guilds
async def account_creation_date(ctx, member: discord.Member):  # user commands return the member
    await ctx.send(f"{member.name}'s account was created on {member.created_at}")
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction profile="bob" contextMenu>
          Account Creation Date
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
      {defaultOptions.profiles.bob.author}'s account was created on 2020-01-01
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>

## Message Commands

```python title="Message Commands Example"
@bot.message_command(name="Get Message ID")  # creates a global message command. use guild_ids=[] to create guild-specific commands.
async def get_message_id(ctx, message: discord.Message):  # message commands return the message
    await ctx.respond(f"Message ID: `{message.id}`")
```

<DiscordComponent>
  <DiscordMessage profile="bob">
    Do. Or do not. There is no try.
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage profile="robocord">
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction
        author="Other Guide Man"
        avatar="green"
        contextMenu
      >
        Get Message ID
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Message ID: <code>930650407917748286</code>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordComponent>
