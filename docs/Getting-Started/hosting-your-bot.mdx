# Hosting Your Pycord Bot

If you're completely new to this, you might have thought something along the lines of "Yay! I got my
bot working," after following our [Creating your First Bot](creating-your-first-bot) guide, only
to close your IDE or shut down your computer to find your bot offline.

The reason for this is that programs have to be hosted somewhere, meaning some machine somewhere has
to constantly run your bot. There are tons of hosting services that can help you host your bot for
little to no cost.

## Can I get a Clear Explanation?

Sure thing. When you run your bot, it first makes a connection to Discord's API. Once that's done,
Pycord sends "heartbeats" to Discord. "heartbeats" are small packets sent at a set interval telling
Discord that your bot is indeed still alive. If Discord doesn't receive a heartbeat after a certain
amount of time, your bot is pronounced dead and buried in the graveyard (not really). It is, though,
taken offline and its connection with Discord is terminated. 

Once you close your terminal that you've run your program on, the program is no longer running, and 
the bot stops sending heartbeats and can no longer process commands. This is why you have to constantly
keep the process running.

This goes for all programs, in a different nature. If the code isn't compiled/built/assembled/interpreted/whatever, 
it can't be running.

## What is a Host?

A host is a server or container for running code offered by a **hosting provider.** There are a lot
of hosting providers, such as bigger ones like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, and smaller
ones like GalaxyGate and DigitalOcean.

There are three types of hosts.

    <TabItem value="hosttype-shared" label="Shared Hosting">
        Shared hosting is a type of hosting where multiple people share one VPS. Getting a spot on
        a shared host is usually cheap, sometimes even free. Shared hosts do not give you a lot of 
        resources, from less than a gigabyte of RAM (usually 512mb on free hosts) and half of a CPU 
        with very little storage. Shared hosting is usually used for website hosting and is not 
        recommended for hosting a Discord bot.

    <TabItem value="hosttype-vps" label="VPS" default>
        A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual computer (virtual machine) that is rented out to
        customers. Most people use a VPS for hosting their projects such as Discord bots. You can get
        anywhere from less than a gigabyte of RAM and a less powerful CPU to just under one hundred
        gigabytes of RAM, a powerful CPU, and a fair amount of storage. A VPS is the best choice for
        most users, and can be fairly cheap.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="hosttype-dedicated" label="Dedicated">
        A dedicated host is a physical computer. You can buy these yourself or rent one from a hosting
        provider. A Raspberry Pi can be considered a dedicated host. Dedicated hosts are often very
        expensive, but are also very powerful, having a few hundred gigabytes of RAM and a few very
        powerful CPUs, along with a good amount of storage. Dedicated hosts are usually used for very
        large projects and are overkill for something like a Discord bot.

Make sure you choose a hosting provider you trust. If you need, you can ask around in communities
or even [Pycord's official support server](https://pycord.dev/discord) for trusted hosts. Just make
sure the hosting provider you're looking at has good reviews on public forums. Googling along the 
lines of "[host] review" should do the trick.

:::

Most hosting providers rent their services to you for a monthly or yearly fee. These can be anywhere
from a few dollars to hundreds or thousands of dollars.

## How to Host Your Bot

Once you rent or buy a VPS, you can get to work. Most hosting providers allow you to choose from a 
wide range of operating systems, most allowing you to choose one but some allowing you to choose 
multiple. Once that's ready, you have to SSH into the system. We won't get into SSH here, but you can
read [this article from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys).
You can also use VNC, which is a remote desktop software. If you are using an OS that does not have a
GUI, and is only command line (a "server" OS), such as Ubuntu Server or Windows Server, you will most
likely use SSH. If you are using an OS that has a GUI, you will most likely use VNC.

Once you've decided your operating system, you'll want to set it up and install Python. Once that's
done, you can copy your bot's files to your remote system, install the required packages, and run
the bot. 

:::warning

If you are using SSH to run the file, your bot will not stay running. This is because the file is
only told to run during your session. You can use a command like [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup)
to make sure your file stays running after you disconnect.
