# More Features to Make Your Bot Snazzy
So you've created your first Pycord bot, but its messages are plain text and the formatting is rather
bland. Luckily, Pycord supports features to make your bot good lookin'.
 
## Embeds
Embeds are a Discord feature that allows applications to format their messages in cool embedded format,
enabling your bot to lay out messages with a lot of text into neat fields.
 
### Creating an Embed
With Pycord, it's easy to create and send embeds. Here's an example:
 
```py
import discord
 
bot = discord.Bot()
 
@bot.command(description="Sends an Embed!")
async def send_embed(ctx)
    embed = discord.Embed(
        title="My Embed",
        description="Pycord makes embeds easy to use and create!",
        color=discord.Colour.blue()
    )
 
    embed.add_field(title="The Best Lib", value="Pycord is the best lib!")
    embed.add_field(title="Inline Fields?", value="Of course we support inline fields!", inline=True)
 
    embed.set_footer(text="This is an embed generated with Pycord.")
    embed.set_author(name="Pycord Embed", icon="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89700626")
    embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89700626")
    embed.set_image(url="pycord-banner")
 
    await ctx.respond(embed=embed)
 
bot.run("TOKEN")
```
 
This simple command sends replies to a [slash command](../Interactions/slash-commands) with an embed.
Let's break it down:
 
```py
embed = discord.Embed(
    title="My Embed",
    description="Pycord makes embeds easy to use and create!",
    color=discord.Colour.blue()
)
```
 
This command creates an embed. We use the [`Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed)
class to create an embed object with the title "MyEmbed," the description "Pycord makes embeds easy
to use and create!," and the color blue.
 
[discord.Colour](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#colour) is a class full of [classmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod)
that return color values. While the official, documented name of this is `discord.Colour`, `discord.Color`
works as well. 
 
```py
embed.add_field(title="The Best Lib", value="Pycord is the best lib!")
embed.add_field(title="Inline Fields?", value="Of course we support inline fields!", inline=True)
```
 
This small section shows off embed fields. You can add fields to embeds with the [`add_field` method](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.add_field)
of the [`discord.Embed`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#embed) class. These consist of three 
keyword arguments: `title`, `value`, and `inline`. `title` and `value` are both required arguments, While
`inline` defaults to `False` if not specified.
 
```py
embed.set_footer(text="This is an embed generated with Pycord.")
embed.set_author(name="Pycord Embed", icon="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89700626")
embed.set_thumbnail(url="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89700626")
embed.set_image(url="pycord-banner")
```
 
In this section, we're adding unique items to the embed. These items are:
- Footer - With the [`set_footer()`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_footer)
method, you can set a small footer that holds a message. This has `text` and `icon_url` kwargs.
- Author - With the [`set_author`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_author)
method, you can set an author for the embed. This is a small text field at the top of the embed. This
includes `name`, `url` and `icon_url` kwargs.
- Thumbnail - With the [`set_thumbnial`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_thumbnail)
method, you can set a small image to reside at the top-right of the embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
- Image - With the [`set_image`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Embed.set_image)
method, you can set an image to sit at the bottom of an embed. This has a single `url` kwarg.
 
There are, of course, more methods and items you can use to configure embeds. Here, we just covered
the basics. 
 
## Markdown
Markdown is a type of markup language that's limited in terms of formatting yet simple. Discord allows
for a watered-down version of markdown to be in their messages. This includes:
 
- `*italics*`
- `**bold**`
- `***italics and bold***`
- `~~strikethrough~~`
- `__underlined__`
- `___italics and underlined___`
- \`Code Text\`
- \```
Code Blocks
\```
 
Sadly, Discord does not support other types, such as hyperlinks. The only place hyperlinks are supported
are in embeds and messages sent through webhooks.
 
Adding markdown to your embeds or messages will give your bot the sparkle it needs.
 
:::caution
 
Some embed fields, such as the footer, do not support markdown *at all*, including bold and italics.
