Excited to create your first bot? Once you [install Pycord](installation.mdx), you can start right away!

## Creating the Bot Application

Just like how you need to sign up to use Discord, your bot also has to be signed up. To do this, you should:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click
   on <button class="blurplebutton">New Application</button>.
2. Give your bot a name, and click <button class="blurplebutton">Create</button>.
3. Now, you should see a page like this.

4. Click on <button class="greybutton">Bot</button> tab on the left side of the screen.
5. Click on <button class="blurplebutton">Add bot</button>.
6. You can give it a name, change the Avatar, etc.

## Inviting the bot

Now, lets get the bot added to some servers. Go to the <button class="greybutton">OAuth2</button> tab in the left pane,
and select `bot` and `applications.commands` as scopes.

The `applications.commands` scope allows the bot to use slash commands, which you may want to have.

Next, you want to choose what permissions the bot will have and select them. For now, give your bot the administrator
permission, meaning the bot will have all the permissions. Once you select the permissions, click on copy to get the bot
invite link.

:::tip

When your bot is all ready to go, make sure that administrator permissions aren't selected unless your bot truly needs them. Try selecting only permissions the bot will need. For testing, administrator is fine.

You can use this link to invite the bot.

## Tokens

Now that we have an account for our bot, we need to login. In order to login, we need the bot's password. All users and
bots have a "token." You may think of a token as a unique password, since this is what we use to log into the bot and
connect it to Discord.

Tokens are "snowflakes." Not actual snowflakes, though. Just like how no two snowflakes in real life have the same
pattern, snowflakes in computers are unique things - no two bots have the same token - so a token is considered a snowflake. A Discord user ID
is also a snowflake.

Now, lets get our bot's token. To do this, you want to:

1. Go back to the <button class="greybutton">Bot</button> tab.
2. Click on the <button class="blurplebutton">Copy</button> button in the "Token" section.

Now, you have your bot's token copied to your clipboard.

Never leak your bot's token, and never share it with anyone. Even if you get any DMs and someone tells you to do so, perhaps claiming to be Discord Staff, do not do so. They are probably lying and are scamming you. Anyone with your token will be able to access your bot fully. They will be able to do anything they want with your bot.

Never push it to GitHub, or send it with the code. One way to prevent your token from getting leaked is to store it in `.env` files.

### Protecting Tokens

#### Using dotenv

You can store your tokens in `.env` files. This is a simple way to store sensitive information.

1. Create a file with the name `.env`. Just `.env`, with the dot/period at the start.
2. Define the token in the file, like

   ```env
   TOKEN = [PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE]
   ```

   for example

   ```env
   TOKEN = NzkyNzE1NDU0MTk2MDg4ODQy.X-hvzA.Ovy4MCQywSkoMRRclStW4xAYK7I
   ```

3. Install [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
   ```bash
   python -m pip install python-dotenv
   ```

If your code is in a git repository, you should create a file called `.gitignore` and add `.env` to it. This means that
whenever you use the `git push` command, your .env file will not be pushed along with the rest of your code. It will stay secure in your local system.

## Coding the Basics

```py
import discord
import os # default module
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv() # load all the variables from the env file
bot = discord.Bot(debug_guilds=[881207955029110855])

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"{bot.user} is ready and online!")

@bot.slash_command(name = "hello", description = "Say hello to the bot")
async def hello(ctx):
    await ctx.send("Hey!")

bot.run(os.getenv('TOKEN')) # run the bot with the token
```

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>
        hello
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Hey!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Let's go through the code. First, the imports.

```py
import discord
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

In the first line, `import discord`, we import Pycord. Although you install Pycord with `pip install py-cord`, you
import it with `import discord`. This is so it's as easy as possible when switching from Discord.py to Pycord.

We then import `os` and `dotenv`. `os` is a default module that we will use to get the token from the env file. `dotenv`
is a module that we will use to load the env file. You installed this with `pip install python-dotenv`.

Next, we load the env file with `load_dotenv()`.

```py
bot = discord.Bot(debug_guilds=[881207955029110855])
```

We create a new instance of [`discord.Bot`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot). In the `debug_guilds` argument, we pass a list of guild IDs where we want to test the bot. Remember to change the
list and add a server where both you and the bot are, and you (preferably) have admin permissions. Normally, you do not
pass this kwarg. However, if you do not specify this, the slash commands will take up to an hour to show up in all the
guilds the bot is in. When you restrict the commands to a few guilds, you can instantly see the commands. You can also
choose to make lone commands restricted to a few guilds, but we will learn about that later.

```py
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"{bot.user} is ready and online!")
```

We use the [`event`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.event) decorator
and [`on_ready`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.on_ready) as a function name to define a function that will be called
when the bot is ready. This is automatically called when the bot is ready to be used.

```py
@bot.slash_command(name = "hello", description = "Say hello to the bot")
async def say_hello(ctx):
    await ctx.send("Hey!")
```

Here, we use the [`slash_command`](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/api.html#discord.Bot.slash_command) decorator to
define a slash command. We specify the `name` and `description` arguments. If not specified, the name of the slash command becomes the name of the function. The description will remain empty.

Finally, you want to run the bot using the token specified in the `.env` file.

Now, you are done with creating your first bot! This is the basic structure of a Pycord bot. What else can you do? The sky is
the limit! Pycord will not limit your imagination. The better you know Python, the more you can do.

## FAQ

### How do I make prefixed commands?

You can read [this amazing page that doesn't exist](../Extensions/Commands/) and idk how it is gonna be linked
but it should (hopefully) be there by the time you read this page.
