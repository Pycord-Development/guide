# Voice
Welcome to the guide for voice features in Pycord.

:::caution

This guide will assume you already have experience with Pycord.

## Requirements
The only requirement needed for voice features is [`PyNaCl`](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/). The following features are optional:

  - [`FFmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) used for sending/receiving files other than `.pcm` and `.wav`
  - [`Pycord.Wavelink`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/Pycord.Wavelink), [`Lavalink.py`](https://github.com/Devoxin/Lavalink.py), [`Wavelink`](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) or anyother python lavalink lib for music playing.
